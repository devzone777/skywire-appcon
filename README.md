# skywire-appcon
Connector app for access to Skywire environment 

This app is a starting point for developing a new app. In it's basic form, it provides a way to create an app environment for a specific or new app and pass that environment info into local variables that can be used by an application outside of the Skywire native environment i.e. a desktop application. 

The app can be used as a template to build upon versus using the API endpoint for Env values.
